3D Plotter is a library that repurposes a 3D printer using the DRV-8823 stepper motor controllers. It gives low-level hardware control of individual motors whlie also providing high level plotting using Numpy arrays. Currently, a RPi utilizes those stepper motor controllers with the GPIO library and is sent movements for higher level plotting with the use of a client-server connection from an outside machine.
